As a history enthusiast, I have always loved reading about kings and generals from around the world. Over time, I noticed a striking contrast: Western history is extensively documented, while ancient Indian history often lacks the same level of detail. Even within India, the history of Bengal remains in the shadows.

This project aims to bring that history to light. I created a timeline tracker website where users can visually explore the flow of Bengal’s kings and rulers, based on credible historical sources. The goal is to make the region’s rich past more accessible and easier to understand.

I would love any feedback, especially regarding additional sources, historical data, and literature recommendations. If you know any must-read books or academic references on Bengal’s dynasties and rulers, your suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
